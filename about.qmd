# Bio

Hello everyone! I'm Moran Guo, a current ScM student studying biostatistics at [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu). I graduated from [University of Rochester](https://rochester.edu) with a B.S. in Biological Sciences: Computational Biology (Magna Cum Laude) and minors in Mathematics & Japanese. During my last two years of undergraduate study, I researched protein coevolution and protein folding, utilizing AlphaFold and Bayesian Graphical Models to investigate correlated mutations. Moving forward, I’m eager to explore all possibilities in the field of biostatistics, with a particular interest in causal inference and Bayesian methods.

Outside of academics, I’m also a huge fan of rock climbing (especially bouldering) and working out. My home gym is [Movement Hampden](https://movementgyms.com/hampden/). I just recovered from a moderate ankle sprain. Besides that, I also enjoy pop Japanese culture, electronic music and watching tennis. In the near future, I might consider taking up squash or golf—or maybe both!
