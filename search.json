    "text": "Bio\nHello everyone! I’m Moran Guo, a current ScM student studying biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. I graduated from University of Rochester with a B.S. in Biological Sciences: Computational Biology (Magna Cum Laude) and minors in Mathematics & Japanese. During my last two years of undergraduate study, I researched protein coevolution and protein folding, utilizing AlphaFold and Bayesian Graphical Models to investigate correlated mutations. Moving forward, I’m eager to explore all possibilities in the field of biostatistics, with a particular interest in causal inference and Bayesian methods.\nOutside of academics, I’m also a huge fan of rock climbing (especially bouldering) and working out. My home gym is Movement Hampden. I just recovered from a moderate ankle sprain. Besides that, I also enjoy pop Japanese culture, electronic music and watching tennis. In the near future, I might consider taking up squash or golf—or maybe both!\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDegree\nInstitution\nMajor\nDuration\nLocation\n\n\n\n\nScM\nJohns Hopkins University  Bloomberg School of Public Health\nBiostatistics\nSep 2024 - May 2026*  anticipated\nBaltimore, MD\n\n\nB.S.\nUniversity of Rochester\nComputational Biology  (Magna cum laude & Honors in Research)\nJan 2021 - May 2024\nRochester, NY\n\n\nMinor\nUniversity of Rochester\nMathematics & Japanese\nJan 2021 - May 2024\nRochester, NY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPictures of Me (and my interests)\n\n\n\n\nAt Japan Osaka Castle\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring Japan\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduation Day\n\n\n\n\n\nBouldering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am also a Jellycat fan!

    "text": "Summary\nFrom the plots and the tables, we can conclude that:\n\nThe three Iris species’ petal and sepal characteristics are so different that is well-separable. From the scatterplot, we can observe that setosa has shorter, wider sepals & tiny petals compared to the other two species. From the distribution we can deduce that setosa can be well-predicted, since the data points corresponds to this species have a clear boundary separating them from the rest of the group.\nIris setosa has a wide range of Petal.Ratio, whereas the rest of the two species exhibited dense and relative low Petal.Ratio statistics. Combined with the result of the first scatterplot, this suggest that both the widths and the lengths of the Iris setosa samples are more variable compared to the other two species.\nBased on the third figure, the Sepal.Length of Iris versicolor and Iris virginica are more variable although their Petal.Ratio are consistent compared to Iris setosa. So we can conclude that the petal dimensions of Iris versicolor and Iris virginica are relatively consistent, but their sepal size tend to vary.\nFrom the result of PCA, we can see that PC1 well-separated the Iris setosa from the rest of the two species. Iris virginica and Iris versicolor had a decent separation by PC1 with some overlaps. This visualization (finding) is consistent with the PCs summary statistics, where around \\(73\\%\\) of the variation is explained by PC1. What factor contributes to the PC1? Based on the last plot showing the PCA loadings, we can see that Petal.Length and Petal.Width features are the two features that strongly influenced PC1. Considering PC1 is so important, this finding suggest that information about petal dimensions informed us the most about the species of Iris."
