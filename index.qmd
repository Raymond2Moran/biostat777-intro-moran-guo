Hi there! I'm Moran, you can also call me Raymond. As a graduate student, I'm passionate about all kinds of knowledge in the field of biostatistics, or broadly public health questions. I enjoy doing statistical analysis and solving statistical and/or mathematical problems; particularly, those theoretical methods attract me. Outside of academics, I am an active climber, intermediate (but passionate) chef, and currently looking forward to participate in hiking. I also love Japanese culture and I've obtained the [JLPT N3 certificate](https://www.jlpt.jp/e/about/levelsummary.html). Feel free to chat with me about [Riichi Majhong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_mahjong)!
